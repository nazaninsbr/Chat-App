# Chat App

My very firt `Elixir` application!! I am super happy right now:))<br>

this program is based on this tutorial <a href="https://sheharyar.me/blog/simple-chat-phoenix-elixir/">https://sheharyar.me/blog/simple-chat-phoenix-elixir/</a><br>

you can run it by:<br>
```
$ cd chatroom 
$ mix phoenix.server
```
<br>and you can see the program in your browser on `localhost:4000`<br>
This is what it looks like:<br>
